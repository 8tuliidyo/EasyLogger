House of Saddam is a fascinating and informative series that will keep you hooked from start to finish. Whether you are a fan of history, politics, or drama, you will not regret watching this miniseries that tells the story of one of the most notorious dictators in the world.
  
One of the most striking aspects of House of Saddam is the portrayal of Saddam Hussein by Yigal Naor, an Israeli actor who bears a remarkable resemblance to the Iraqi leader. Naor delivers a powerful and nuanced performance that captures Saddam's charisma, ruthlessness, ambition, insecurity, and vulnerability. Naor said that he studied Saddam's speeches, interviews, and body language to prepare for the role, and that he tried to understand his psychology and emotions without judging him. Naor also said that he felt a connection with Saddam as a fellow Arab and a victim of colonialism. Naor's performance was praised by critics and viewers alike, who found him convincing and compelling as Saddam.
  
Another standout performance in House of Saddam is by Shohreh Aghdashloo, an Iranian-American actress who plays Saddam's first wife Sajida Talfah. Aghdashloo portrays Sajida as a loyal, devoted, and protective wife who loves Saddam despite his infidelity, cruelty, and tyranny. Aghdashloo said that she accepted the role because she wanted to show the world the suffering of Iraqi women under Saddam's regime, and that she felt sympathy for Sajida as a woman who was trapped in a loveless marriage with a dictator. Aghdashloo also said that she faced some backlash from some Iranians who accused her of betraying her country by playing the wife of its enemy. Aghdashloo's performance was acclaimed by critics and viewers alike, who found her moving and authentic as Sajida.
  
House of Saddam is not only a drama about the personal lives of Saddam and his family, but also a historical account of the political events that shaped Iraq and the Middle East in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The series depicts the major milestones of Saddam's rule, such as his war with Iran, his invasion of Kuwait, his conflict with the United States, his weapons of mass destruction program, his human rights violations, and his capture and execution. The series also shows the impact of these events on the Iraqi people, who suffered from poverty, oppression, violence, and sanctions under Saddam's regime. The series does not glorify or demonize Saddam or his actions, but rather tries to present them in a factual and balanced way. The series was praised by critics and viewers alike for its historical accuracy and relevance.
